EXAMPLES:

Q: Show the average rating of suppliers by country.
A:
SELECT country, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
FROM info.suppliers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 5;

Q: List the top 3 customers by total amount spent.
A:
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM info.customers c
JOIN info.orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 3;

Q: Identify the products that show a consistent month-over-month revenue growth in the last 4 months.
A:
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name
FROM info.products p
JOIN info.order_details od ON p.product_id = od.product_id
JOIN info.orders o ON od.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '4 months'

)
LIMIT 5;

Q: Categorize each supplier as Top, Average, or Low performer based on total revenue from their products.
A:
SELECT
  s.supplier_id,
  s.company_name,
  SUM(od.final_amount) AS total_revenue,
  CASE
    WHEN SUM(od.final_amount) > (SELECT AVG(total_revenue) FROM (

LIMIT 5;

Q: For each customer, show their total spend and their rank among all customers by total spend (window function).
A:
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.first_name,
  c.last_name,
  SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(o.total_amount) DESC) AS spending_rank
FROM info.customers c

Q: Find customers who have purchased ALL products in the 'Electronics' category (nested subquery).
A:

FROM info.customers c

    SELECT 1 FROM info.products p
    WHERE p.category = 'Electronics'

STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Output ONLY the SQL query. DO NOT include explanations, tool calls, function calls (such as SubmitFinalAnswer), code blocks, or any answer or commentary.
- DO NOT output any text, tool call, or answer after the SQL. ONLY the SQL query must be in your response.
- DO NOT call any function or tool, DO NOT output SubmitFinalAnswer, DO NOT output a final answer or summary.
- DO NOT wrap your output in code blocks.
- DO NOT output anything except the SQL.

ADDITIONAL SQL GENERATION GUIDELINES:
- Unless the user requests a specific number of results, add LIMIT 5 to your query.
- Prefer to order results by a relevant column for interesting/meaningful answers.
- Never SELECT *; only select the relevant columns needed to answer the question.
- If you cannot answer with the data available, output a SQL query that will return an empty result set (e.g., add WHERE 1=0), but do NOT make anything up.
- NEVER write DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc.). Only SELECT queries are allowed.
